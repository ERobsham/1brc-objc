#  One Billion Row Challenge - Objc



Rules:
* Input value ranges are as follows:
    * Station name: non null UTF-8 string of min length 1 character and max length 100 bytes, containing neither ; nor \n characters. (i.e. this could be 100 one-byte characters, or 50 two-byte characters, etc.)
    * Temperature value: non null double between -99.9 (inclusive) and 99.9 (inclusive), always with one fractional digit
* There is a maximum of 10,000 unique station names
* Line endings in the file are \n characters on all platforms
* Implementations must not rely on specifics of a given data set, e.g. any valid station name as per the constraints above and any data distribution (number of measurements per station) must be supported
* The rounding of output values must be done using the semantics of IEEE 754 rounding-direction "roundTowardPositive"


Output example:
```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Abéché=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```
